# TriviaGame

In this game, the user will press Start to begin a Trivia Game. Once the start button is pressed, a series of questions with multiple choice answers will be displayed (all at once), and a timer starts for 1 minute. Once the user presses the Submit button, or the timer reaches 0, the game will display your number of correct, incorrect, or unanswered questions.

In this assignment, I used setInterval for the timer, bootstrap forms for radio buttons, objects, arrays, for loops, and if statements to code the steps mentioned above. This was done with a combination of jQuery and Javascript. Bootstrap was used for page layout, with some additional separate CSS styling.
